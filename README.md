# Hi, I’m Anubhav 👋

I’m a computer science student with a strong interest in **C++**, problem-solving, and understanding how things work under the hood. I enjoy learning concepts deeply rather than just using them at a surface level, especially when it comes to **data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming**.

I actively work on improving my fundamentals while gradually moving towards **open-source contribution** and collaborative development.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

### Languages
- **C++** (STL, OOP, data structures, problem solving)
- **Python** (general scripting and data analysis)

### Libraries & Tools
- Python: **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**
- Version Control: **Git & GitHub**
- Familiar with writing clean, readable, and maintainable code

### Core CS Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (C++)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Problem solving and logical reasoning
- Basic experience with debugging and code analysis

## 📌 Projects

### 🔹 C++ (Primary Repository)
A collection of C++ programs and practice implementations focused on:
- STL usage
- data structures
- algorithmic problem solving
- improving code clarity and logic

This repository reflects my ongoing learning and experimentation with modern C++ concepts.

> *(Other repositories include small academic projects built for evaluation purposes.)*

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Focusing On
- Strengthening C++ fundamentals and STL usage
- Understanding real-world codebases
- Learning how to contribute effectively to open-source projects
- Preparing for collaborative programs like **Google Summer of Code (GSOC 2026)**

I believe in learning continuously and building skills that will be useful in the long term.
